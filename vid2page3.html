		<p>page 3 is going to have some extra shit written here: blah, blah, blah</p>
		<p class= "secondary">page 3 is going to have even <em>MORE</em> extra shit written here: blah, blah, blah</p>
		<p>Remember that because this is called <em>CASCADING</em> style sheets, anything that comes <em>after</em> on one of those files is going to override what was written <em>before</em>, if it contradicts it.</p>
		<p class= "secondary">However, because a paragraph with a <strong>CLASS</strong> is more <em>SPECIFIC</em> than a paragraph <em>without</em> a class, it won't be overridden if you change the regular, general paragraph style <em>after</em> creating a specific paragraph class with specific rules</p>
