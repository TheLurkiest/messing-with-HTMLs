		<p class= "secondary">However, because a paragraph with a <strong>CLASS</strong> is more <em>SPECIFIC</em> than a paragraph <em>without</em> a class, it won't be overridden if you change the regular, general paragraph style <em>after</em> creating a specific paragraph class with specific rules</p>
